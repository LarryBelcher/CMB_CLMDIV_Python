README for the CMB Climate Division average temperature and total precipitation data visualization


Abstract:
Six python scripts (3 for avg temp and 3 for total precip) are contained in this project 
that display the data onto a map (Albers Equal Area Conic for CONUS region).

Data Provider: CMB @ NOAA NCDC
Dataset: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/
e.g., ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/climdiv-pcpndv-v1.0.0-20140404


Python script listing:

tavgDriver.py (precipDriver.py)	- Drives the mapping and colorbar scripts for avg temp (total precip)

tavgMap.py (precipMap.py)	- Creates a map image of the avg temp (total precip) data

tavgColorbar.py (precipColorbar.py)	- Creates a corresponding colorbar for avg temp (total precip)


Program Usage:

TBA...


Valid “image size” values are:
620 (620px wide image)
1000 (1000px wide image)
DIY (4096px wide image)
HD (1920px wide image in high definition)
HDSD (1920px wide image suitable for either high definition or standard definition



Software and Dependencies:

The scripts included here were built for Python 2.7. The following
modules must exist on the system for them to perform correctly:

matplotlib-1.1.1 (or higher)
PIL (python imaging library, 1.1.7 or higher, PIL is the Python Imaging Library)
mpl_toolkits.basemap
numpy
sys
os
subprocess
time
matplotlib.font_manager (in order to utilize the true type font MS Trebuchet, which is not
	included as a "base" font in python*)
	*The usage of PIL and the font manager inside matplotlib in these scripts requires
	the ability to utilize true type fonts. As such for example on a linux box, one would
	need to have installed the freetype-dev packages. Specifically, libfreetype6-dev needs
	to be installed on ubuntu... 

Other files in this project:
colorbar and logo (.png and .eps) files included here are sized for each of the image 
sizes and are used by the various python scripts that produce the reprojected images



Notes on portability:

1) All image making scripts in the project need the path to Trebuchet MS true-type font.
e.g.,

	/usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/Trebuchet_MS.ttf

	*This path depends entirely on the location the sysadmin installs “add-on” fonts.
